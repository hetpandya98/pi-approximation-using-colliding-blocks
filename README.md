# pi-approximation-using-colliding-blocks

This is a simple simulation to approximate the value of pi. The simulation is written in Processing, which is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment.

The whole approach behind this simulation is taken from 3Blue1Brown youtube channel. You can find the video explaining the approach here : [3B1B video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE&t=1s)
